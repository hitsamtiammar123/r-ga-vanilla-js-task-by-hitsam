# R/GA Javascript task by Hitsam (Vanilla JS version)

Hi, here is my javascript exercise with Vanilla JS version. I made this just for show my skill on vanilla js. Here is the notes:

- I load every library directly from remote url
- I set map on container div
- I use ``flatpickr`` as datetime library
- I dont use many complex style here. Just make simple flexbox and standard input
- I implement every DeckGL implementation as same as on react javascript version
